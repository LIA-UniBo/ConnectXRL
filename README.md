# Connect X

The problem is taken from [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx). The goal of the competition is to create an agent able to play at the famous game connect-4, here generalized to an arbitrary number X. We will use this environment to study and discuss some related interested topics.

## Setup

Easily, creating a Python 3 virtual environment, activating it and running the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to install all the dependencies.

## Explainability in DRL

We are interested in taking this game and explore some advancements in the field of explainability and interpretability of Deep Reinforcement Learning models.
